# Spaceship Titanic Project 

Out with the old and in with the new: This Spaceship Titanic project is an updated version of the original Titanic dataset set in the future. However, instead of predicting which passenger survived or not, we predict if these passengers were transported into another dimension.

This was a fun project to work on and at the time of submission I was in the top 24%

# Catboost
I found Catboost to be the best boosting algorithm to use with the highest accuracy score.
